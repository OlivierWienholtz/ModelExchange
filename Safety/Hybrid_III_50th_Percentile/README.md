## Recommendation

This model is intended for educational and training purposes. The kinematics and mass distribution are fairly accurate, leading to realistic loading of the occupant environment (such as seat structure, restraint systems, instrument panel, etc.).
This model was developed for kinematic assessment only. To predict occupant injury risk, it is recommended to use commercial version of Radioss and safety models available from Altair and his partners, please contact Altair: [https://altair.com/fe-dummy-models]( https://altair.com/fe-dummy-models).
